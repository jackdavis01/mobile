# 8 Queens Performance Benchmark

A Flutter project that demonstrates the power, versatility and multi-platform nature of the Flutter development environment.

## Getting Started

This project contains the source code for the 8 Queens App and all the resources needed to build it on the 5 available platforms.

## 8 Queens: Instructions

8 Queens Performance Benchmark Test And Meter App is a Visual CPU Performance App. You can meter your smart mobile device's speed with the Eight Queens Chess Problem solving.

### The App runs on, and you can download from

1. Android: Google Play
2. iOS: iPhones, iPads, on latest M1 Macintosh desktops, and on M1 MacBook notebooks: App Store
3. Windows desktop: <https://is.gd/8Queens>
4. MacOS desktop: App Store
5. Linux desktop: Snap Store

Search for "8 Queens" or "8 Queens Performance".

### 8 Queens Problem

The App finds the 92 right solutions from the 16 million variations where the eight queens don't threaten each other on the 8x8 chessboard.

### App information

Finding the 92 right solutions with an up-to-date, decent smart mobile phone lasts less than a half minute.
If you would like to see the right solutions, please choose '1 sec' or '5 sec' wait at 'No Wait'.
If you would like to check your smart phone's multithreaded CPU performance please, choose 2 or '4 Threads'.

The App uses brute force method to find the right solutions. Since this App is a Performace Benchmark, it was not intended to use an algorithm faster than the brute force method. Any more efficient algorithm would run too fast on a flagship device.

Not all iterations are displayed. Only about every 5000th iteration is displayed. Therefore, outputing to the display slows down max. 10% on the algorithm.
