Privacy Policy Update (3rd of December, 2024): Advertising and Data Collection

Our app now includes advertisements provided by Google AdMob and ironSource. Please note the following changes to our data collection practices related to advertising:

1. AdMob & ironSource Integration

    We have integrated Google AdMob and ironSource as an advertising provider to deliver ads that may be relevant to you. AdMob and ironSource may collect and use data to show targeted ads based on your interests.

2. Collection of Advertising ID

    To facilitate personalized advertising, our app collects the Advertising ID from your device. The Advertising ID is a unique identifier assigned to your device for advertising purposes and is managed by the operating system. This identifier is used to serve personalized ads and improve ad relevance.

3. Third-Party Data Use

    The data collected by Google AdMob is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy and data processing practices. You may review Google’s Privacy Policy for more details on how Google handles your data.
    The data collected by ironSource is governed by ironSource’s Privacy Policy and data processing practices. You may review ironSource’s Privacy Policy for more details on how ironSource handles your data.

4. Opt-Out Option

    You can opt out of personalized ads by changing your device settings:

    - On Android: Go to Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization.

    - On iOS: Go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking.

By continuing to use this app, you agree to the integration of Google AdMob & ironSource ads and the collection of your Advertising ID for advertising purposes.
